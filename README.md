# Lux & Lucid Iris
Video Mandala Mixer. Simple 2 Channel Video Mixer featuring a fancy Mandala Shader. Drag and drop your videos to the Video input fields of Channel A & B. You can change the Image in the middle by dragging a image to the Logo Input Field. The App uses Audio Input to trigger a Vignette Shader and to display circular waveform around the Logo Image. I wrote this to use it for some video installations. It's prototyping code, the performance could be improved.

## Installation
You need node and npm installed on your machine. It should work on all platforms electron supports. I only tested in on a linux machine.

```
npm install
```

## Run

```
npm start
```
